MINECRAFT HOUSE: PROMPT!!!

Technical specs:
- Vanilla minecraft (for a recent version!)
- You can cheat!

High concept:
- vampire residence!
- imposing exterior! cozy interior!

Design notes:
- Vampires have frequent guests, who like well-lit rooms with a cell-like floorplan
- People really ought to have their own bathrooms: shower preferably included
- They like to sleep in darkened rooms with high ceilings
- Tall or multistory buildings are cool

Material notes:
- Most stone types are great: dark wood is great

Architectural features:
- I like courtyards that are bounded on all sides by building parts.
- I like balconies, as well as outdoor areas with shade.
- Separated kitchen, living, and dining rooms are great.
- Closets are useful. Study space is useful.
- A library would be a great idea!
- A garden would be a great idea.

Practical features:
- Enough room for the majority of ingame house features (ex: furnaces, crafting tables)
